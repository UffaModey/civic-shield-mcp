## An AI-powered Digital Rights Risk Analyzer for Activists

Digital rights activists (especially women, youth, and marginalised communities) are often forced to engage with:

- Platform Terms of Service
- Donor agreements
- Data protection laws
- Surveillance policies

These documents are:

- Legally complex
- Written for corporations, not communities
- Potentially harmful if misunderstood

CivicShield MCP helps activists understand risk before harm happens.
